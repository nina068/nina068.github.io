Question 1: what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?
Yes, it changed a lot. Before I learned R course, I thought statistical interpretaiton was most important and coding was just a suplement toole to statistics, But right now, my mind is changed. Coding played a very important role in statistics. It can give us plots, data maniputlation summary, modeling, etc.. Also, coding language like R is a hard course to learn, and it needs lots of time to focus on. 


Question 2: what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
Yes, I will use R. 
R is a very importan coding tool, not only used in statistics, but also in regular life. When you just need a plot which needs to look cool, you can use R to do it for you and it is very easily and time-saving. I will keep using R and learning it. 

Question 3: what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
To learn R or anything new well, you need time and dive yourself in it. But, to be honest, I did not learn R well because I did not put lots of time in it. I mainly focused on the lecture video, but did not finish the readings. Anyway, I will keep learning it. 
In practice, except Microsoft Excel, I will use R to do calculation, ploting and data summary.
