In projec 2, we read in and analyzed an online news popularity data set. We analyzed six different data channel, such as business, tech, lifestyle, world, socem and entertainment. Summeries like mean and standard deviation of variables were summarized and plot for better visulization. After that, we split the data from business channel into training data and test data. We applied four models which are simple linear model, multiple linear model, random forest model and boosted tree model to training data set and selected the best fit to training data set based on the lowest RMSE. The best fit was then applied to test data set to predict popularity of online business news.   

Next step, we adapted code to other five data channel whch were tech, lifestyle, world, socem and entertainment. But we were unable to get the automation to work with the filter statement, so only entertainment html file was created.  

• what would you do differently?  
Actually, I would like to have six Rmd.file seperately because automation part is really tough. 

• what was the most difficult part for you?  
The project sense and code sense are difficult to me. How to extract useful information from articles and transfer it to statistical problems is especially difficult to me. Furthermore, complex code is also difficult to me. Sometimes, it's hard to read through and understand the complex code.   

• what are your big take-aways from this project?  
I began to know a little about how to split a project into several parts and for every part, write out the code first, and at last to put all code together to see if it made sense and worked.
