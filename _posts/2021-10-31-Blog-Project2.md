In projec 2, we read in online data to inspect 


• what would you do differently?
Actually, I don't have much clue 

• what was the most difficult part for you?
The project sense and code sense are difficult to me. How to extract useful information from articles and transfer it to statistical problems is especially difficult to me. 
Complex code is also difficult to me. Ofte, It's hard to read throough and understand the complex code. 

• what are your big take-aways from this project?
Began to know a little how to split a project into several parts and for every part, write out the code first, and at last to put all code together to see if it makes sense.
